# <center>Short Bio</center>

I am a Ph.D. student working under the supervision of Dr. [Prem Kumar Kalra](http://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~sayan/) at the School of Information Technology at [IIT Delhi](https://cse.iitd.ac.in).


Research Interests:

   **1. Topological Deep Learning**   
   **2. Graphs**   
   **3. Point Clouds**   
   **4. Geometric Deep Learning**
 <br>
Prior to joining IIT Delhi, I worked as a Research Associate in the [Machine learning Group](https://mllab.csa.iisc.ac.in/) at [Indian Institute of Science](https://iisc.ac.in/), Bangalore advised by Prof. [Chiranjib Bhattacharyya]([http://iitg.ernet.in/cse](https://eecs.iisc.ac.in/people/chiranjib-bhattacharyya/)). I received my Master's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from the [Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati](http://iitg.ernet.in/cse).
