# <center>Short Bio</center>

I am a Research Scientist at [PocketFM](https://pocketfm.com/) in the Data Science Team. Prior to joining PocketFM I worked as a Ph.D. scholar(Qualcomm PhD Fellow) under the supervision of Dr. [Sayan Ranu](http://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~sayan/) in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at [IIT Delhi](https://cse.iitd.ac.in).


Research Interests:

   **1. ML and Graphs**   
   **2. Optimization using ML and Graph ML**   
   **3. Generative Modeling**   
   **4. Recommendation Systems and retention. User behavior modeling**

Prior to joining IIT Delhi, I worked as a Research Engineer in the Machine learning and statistics group at Conduent Labs( Formerly Xerox Research Center India). I received my Master's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from the [Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati](http://iitg.ernet.in/cse).
