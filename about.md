# <center>Short Bio</center>

I am a Manager Data Scientist at Mastercard AI Garage, India. I completed my PhD under the supervision of Prof. [Sayan Ranu](http://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~sayan/) at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at [IIT Delhi](https://cse.iitd.ac.in). 


Research Interests:

   **1. ML, Graphs and Optmization. Learning under Data Scarcity.**  
   **3. Generative Modeling**   
   **4. Model bias**
   
 <br>
Previously I worked as a Research Scientist at Pocket FM. Prior to joining IIT Delhi, I worked as a Research Engineer in the Machine learning and statistics group at Conduent Labs( Formerly Xerox Research Center India). I received my Master's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from the [Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati](http://iitg.ernet.in/cse).
